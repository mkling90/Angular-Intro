What is a Component?
Component = Template + Class + Metadata
Component Lifecycle : 
Create -> Render -> Create/Render children -> process changes -> Destroy
Nested components can be used as either a directive, or as a routing target
Pass data to Nested using @Input
Raise event using @Output

Twitter Bootstrap styling framework:
http://getbootstrap.com

Filtering:  
Recommended to be done within the component itself (not a custom pipe)

Building a Service:
Create a service Class, register as a provider in the component or module, then inject in constructor

Routing:
- no selector needed
- Configure routes (Define base element, add routermodule, add each route to routemodule)
- Tie routes to actions (Add routerLink directive as attrribute in a template, bind to a link parameters array)
- Place the view (specifify is host components view)
- Guards can test CanActivate, CanDeactivate, Resolve, and CanLoad
